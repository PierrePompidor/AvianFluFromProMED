The amino acid homology and evolutionary tree were analyzed in DNA-Star and MEGA 6.0 software, and pathogenicity was studied through mouse infection experiments. 8 gene segments of 13 H9N2 strains were derived from 5 different lineages, which belonged to the new genotype. The amino acid sequence identity was 99.0% with respect to A/equine/Guangxi/3/2011 isolated from Guangxi. 6 internal genes were closely related to the H7N9 strain from human influenza virus in 2013. The HA cleavage site of all strains was RSSR-(cleavage site)-GLF, thus indicating low virulence. The amino acid sites HA226, NA119, NP375, and PB2 showed some changes, among which HA226 was changed to leucine L, which binds human SAalpha2, 6-Gal. In BALB/c mice infected with H9N2 virus isolated from healthy dogs, the virus did not replicate in vivo, but the strains Ca/GX/8 and Ca/GX/10 from symptomatic dogs replicated in vivo and caused clear clinical symptoms but not death. The virulence of the virus was enhanced after passage in mice, a finding speculated to be caused by the changes in amino acids at positions PA623 and 611 of PB2. A total of 13 H9N2 subtype influenza virus strains obtained from dogs in Guangxi have avian origin, specifically bind human receptors, and have a complex genetic evolution relationship, thus posing a great threat to mammals and humans. Therefore, prevention and control measures must urgently be strengthened.\n\n--\n"

Several dead harbour seals were collected in the 2nd half of August 2021 by the Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research (ITAW) of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany (TiHo). In samples of 2 animals, highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus (HPAIV) was detected by RT-qPCR at the Institute of Virology (TiHo) on 3 Sep 2021 and immediately reported to the local authorities. Subsequent examinations led to the detection of HPAIV of the subtype H5N8 in both animals with the highest viral genome loads in the brain. Morbillivirus-specific RNA, in contrast, was not detected. Post mortem and virological investigations of a third carcass, processed at the Veterinary Investigation Centre of the German Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein and the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), likewise revealed high viral loads of HPAIV, subtype H5N8, in the brain of the animal. No or very low viral loads of H5N8 were present in other tissues including the lung. Further intensified surveillance has been initiated and special precautionary advice applies to staff recovering and handling clinically affected and dead seals. Further work characterizing the seal viruses is ongoing at TiHo and FLI.\n\n--\nPaul Becher, Alexander Postel, Ursula Siebert, on behalf of the team at TiHo;\nKatharina Kramer, Hubert Wonnemann, Markus Weidner, Gabriela Wallner, on behalf of the Veterinary Investigation Centre Schleswig-Holstein and the responsible State Ministry;\nTimm Harder, Thomas C Mettenleiter, Martin Beer, on behalf of the team at FLI\n\n[Several subtypes of AI viruses (H7N7, H4N5, H4N6, H3N3, and H10N7) have caused epidemics in harbour seals, but they do not appear to become established in this carnivore species. HPAI H5N8 closely related to the virus circulating in poultry farms at the time was detected in 2 gray seals (__Halichoerus grypus_) stranded on the Baltic coast of Poland in 2016 and 2017. In November 2020, a harbor seal (_Phoca vitulina_) and a gray seal were found infected by HPAI H5N8 virus in the context of a seal mortality event in the UK. In seals and other wild mammals, HPAI H5N8 causes encephalitis and death. - Mod.PMB\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map of Germany: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8698675,68604]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza (115): Europe (France) backyard poultry, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210915.8670328\nAvian influenza (112): Europe (France) backyard poultry, HPAI H5N8 20210911.8662208\nAvian influenza (110): Europe (Luxembourg) backyard bird, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210910.8659824\nAvian influenza (108): Europe (Belgium) captive bird, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210908.8652190\nAvian influenza (105): Europe (Netherlands) wild bird, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210830.8632118\nAvian influenza (100): Europe (Netherlands) wild bird, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210818.8604361\nAvian influenza (94): Europe (Denmark) poultry, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210707.8499767\nAvian influenza (85): Europe (Albania) poultry, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210621.8464003\nAvian influenza (81): Europe (Albania) poultry, HPAI H5N8, 1st outbreak 20210612.8443314\nAvian influenza (77): Europe (Netherlands) poultry, HPAI H5N8 20210602.8417795\nAvian influenza (75): Europe (Lithuania, Germany) poultry, bird, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210601.8415504\nAvian influenza (59): Europe (Germany) poultry, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210412.8303400\nAvian influenza (57): Europe (Germany) poultry, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210409.8298793\nAvian influenza (50): Europe (UK) poultry, HPAI H5N8 20210329.8276712\nAvian influenza (45): Europe (UK, Croatia) seal, fox, wild bird, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20210317.8252821\nAvian influenza (44): Europe, wild bird, H5N8, H5N5, OIE 20210316.8251236\nAvian influenza (36): Europe, wild bird, HPAI H5N5, H5N8, OIE 20210217.8196269\nAvian influenza (34): Europe, wild bird, poultry, HPAI H5N5, H5N8, H5N3, OIE 20210213.8189223\nAvian influenza (29): Europe, wild bird, poultry HPAI H5N8, H5N4, LPAI H7N7, OIE 20210207.8171652\nAvian influenza (25): Europe (Bulgaria) poultry, HPAI, st pending 20210205.8166203\nAvian influenza (20): Europe, poultry, captive bird, H5N8, H5N5, OIE 20210128.8139638\nAvian influenza (18): Europe, wild bird, H5N8, OIE 20210124.8132562\nAvian influenza (16): Europe, wild bird, poultry, HPAI H5N1, H5N3, H5N5, OIE 20210121.8123930\n2020\n----\nAvian influenza (114): UK, Germany, poultry, wild bird, HPAI H5N1, H5N3, OIE 20201223.8039475\nAvian influenza (113): UK, poultry, captive bird, HPAI H5N8, spread, control 20201219.8031759\nAvian influenza (111): Europe, poultry, captive/wild bird, H5N1, H5N5, H5N8, OIE 20201218.8025563\nAvian influenza (107): Poland, UK, wild bird, HPAI H5N8, H5N5, OIE 20201211.8010816\nAvian influenza (102): Europe, wild bird, poultry, H5N8, H5N5, H5N1, spread 20201202.7988670\nAvian influenza (100): Europe, wild bird, H5N8, H5N5, spread, OIE 20201201.7983360\nAvian influenza (99): UK, wild bird, HPAI H5N8 20201130.7982468\nAvian influenza (98): Europe, wild bird, poultry, H5N8, H5N5, H5, OIE 20201129.7980331\nAvian influenza (95): UK, wild bird, HPAI H5N8 20201125.7971718\nAvian influenza (94): Croatia (KK) poultry HPAI H5N8, OIE 20201124.7968466\nAvian influenza (84): UK (England) wild bird, poultry, HPAI H5N8, OIE 20201112.7938593\nAvian influenza (77): UK (England) poultry, LPAI H5N2, HPAI H5N8 20201103.7913786\n.................................................pmb/mj/ml"

The seal was found dead on a beach on Southwest Funen in September 2021 and examined at the Center for Diagnostics at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) as part of the disease monitoring of fallen game.\n\nThe seal was emaciated with pronounced skin changes on large parts of the body of uncertain significance and cause. Influenza virus was detected in the lung, but otherwise no other disease-causing organisms could be detected that could explain why the seal was dead.\n\nThe Center for Diagnostics at DTU has stated that they examined 29 harbor seals and 15 gray seals in 2021, of which only this one was positive for influenza virus.\n\nUpon further investigation at the Danish Veterinary Consortium, the virus turned out to be highly pathogenic avian influenza  virus of the subtype H5N8.\n\nThe detected virus is closely related to the viruses that have been the cause of bird flu outbreaks in wild birds and domestic poultry since the autumn of 2020, both here and in the rest of Europe.\n\nSeals are known to be susceptible to avian influenza virus.\n\nIn recent seasons with avian influenza in birds, the discovery of HPAI in wild mammals has been increasingly reported, including seals and wild foxes in northern Europe. These findings have been seen primarily in animals with neurological symptoms, or found dead.\n\nWhen mammals are infected with viruses from birds, there is a risk that the virus will mutate and adapt to its new host species and mammals in general.\n\nThe Danish Veterinary Consortium has performed a detailed analysis of the virus genome from the wild seal and found some mutations in the virus that show signs of possible adaptation to mammals, although it was not possible to analyze the full genome due to the quality of the material.\n\n--\n"

        "text": "Abstract\n------------\n\"Eating infected wild birds may put wild carnivores at high risk for infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (H5N1). To determine whether red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) are susceptible to infection with HPAI virus (H5N1), we infected 3 foxes intratracheally. They excreted virus pharyngeally for 3-7 days at peak titers of 103.5-105.2 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL and had severe pneumonia, myocarditis, and encephalitis. To determine whether foxes can become infected by the presumed natural route, we fed infected bird carcasses to 3 other red foxes. These foxes excreted virus pharyngeally for 3-5 days at peak titers of 104.2-104.5 TCID50/mL, but only mild or no pneumonia developed. This study demonstrates that red foxes fed bird carcasses infected with HPAI virus (H5N1) can excrete virus while remaining free of severe disease, thereby potentially playing a role in virus dispersal.\"\n\n"

It is also the first case of avian flu confirmed in a raccoon in North America, according to the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nThe agency is warning pet owners not to let their dogs and cats scavenge sick or dead birds or other wildlife or even interact with sick wildlife. (Rabies is another reason not to let your pet interact with sick wildlife. - Mod.TG]\n\nFour raccoon kits with apparent avian influenza were found at the park at the confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers earlier this month [June 2022], according to Fish and Wildlife. One was tested to confirm the disease. 2 of the kits were dead, and the other 2 were obviously sick and were euthanized.\n\nAvian flu was detected in the Tri-Cities  starting in May this year [2022] in baby geese. Visitors to the park were finding dead goslings and baby geese were walking in circles, having seizures and sitting still and letting people approach them. There followed reports of more geese with avian flu across the Tri-Cities area; a mallard, a duck, and a crow in Richland; a gull at Sacajawea Park; and a sandhill crane in Connell.\n\nTo date, Benton and Franklin counties are not among the 10 counties in Washington with outbreaks in backyard poultry flocks. However, flocks in Spokane and Yakima counties have tested positive. While sick goslings, in particular, continue to be reported, officials have been receiving fewer reports than they did initially, said Staci Lehman with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. Avian flu, or bird flu, is very contagious among birds. It is spread through saliva and feces and surfaces contaminated with them, such as the bottom of shoes.\n\nAvian flu has previously been detected in red foxes and skunks in North America. Elsewhere in the world, it has infected pigs in Asia, domestic cats in Germany, and a domestic dog in Thailand. There's the potential for it to infect other mammals as bird flu viruses evolve, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife does not expect the spread of avian flu to have a large impact at this time on wildlife in the state. People should be watching for it in their backyard flocks of chickens, ducks, and poultry.\n\nOne strain of avian flu, highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI, is generally fatal for birds. But there may be no signs of disease or mild signs such as ruffled feathers or a drop in egg production in the low pathogenic avian influenza, or LPAI, strain. A single sick bird in a flock should be reported to your veterinarian. If multiple birds die or have an unusual illness, you are asked to call the state sick bird hotline at 800-606-3056.\n\nThere is no treatment for the disease. Avian flu is not easily transmissible from birds to people, but there are occasional cases. Just one case in a person in the United States has been reported this spring [2022]. A person who had handled infected poultry tested positive for an avian flu virus.\n\nPeople who see a wild bird or mammal appearing to be infected or dead should report it to the Fish and Wildlife department at https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/bird-flu.\n\nFish and Wildlife recommends common sense precautions to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading avian flu or any wildlife disease:\n- Wear disposable gloves when cleaning harvested birds or cleaning bird feeders.\n- Do not dispose of processed bird carcasses in the field where they could be eaten by scavengers or raptors. Bag them and place in the garbage, bury or incinerate them.\n- Ensure all equipment (boots, clothes, vehicles, firearms) is cleaned and disinfected to prevent the spread of diseases.\n- Do not harvest or handle wild birds which are obviously sick or found dead.\n- Do not eat, drink or smoke while cleaning game.\n- Wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol hand sanitizer immediately after handling game or cleaning bird feeders.\n- Wash tools and work surfaces used to clean game birds with soap and water, then disinfect with a 10% solution of chlorine bleach.\n- Separate raw meat, and anything it touches, from cooked or ready-to-eat foods to avoid contamination.\n- Cook game birds thoroughly. Meat should reach an internal temperature of 155 to 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill disease organisms and parasites.\n- If you experience flu-like symptoms following contact with sick or dead wild birds or have concerns about potential exposure to infected birds, contact the Benton Franklin Health District for recommendations and guidance on monitoring symptoms or possible testing.\n\n\n\n--\n"

The test result was a preliminary positive, which will need to be confirmed by another test at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases in Winnipeg.\n\nIf confirmed, Dr. Megan Jones, assistant professor in wildlife and anatomic pathology at the Atlantic Veterinary College (AVC) and regional director of the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, said it will be the 1st case of avian influenza in an Island mammal. \"We've tested some other mammals, and they were negative, just to have it on our radar,\" she said. \"Since the virus showed up, we've been doing more testing for it, in general, just to track where it's going and what it's doing.\"\n\nSouthwest Lot 16 resident Candy Gallant, operator of PEI Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Inc., had been informed of sick fox kits on Sunday 15 May 2022. Initially, Gallant suspected the foxes had consumed either rat poisoning or antifreeze, due to the symptoms -- primarily seizures.\n\nUnable to get the animals herself, Gallant had asked a friend, Kyra Deschene, to go and check out the fox kits. When Dechene arrived in Augustine Cove, she observed one fox kit lying on the ground convulsing and one more lethargic kit curled up in a tight ball.\n\nShe tended to the convulsing kit, first, and put her in a carrier, before moving on to its sibling. \"There was nothing noticeable, outside of his behaviour (being) strange,\" said Deschene. \"There was no discharge, diarrhea...normal things that you would expect to see if it was some sort of sickness.\"\n\nDeschene planned to put the 2nd fox in a carrier as well but ended up holding him while she transported the foxes to Gallant's house. Mid-journey, the 2nd fox also began convulsing. \"It's pretty distressing,\" said Deschene, who considers herself an animal lover. \"When it's little babies, it's always worse.\"\n\nUpon arrival at Gallant's house, the 2 foxes were euthanized. \"It was horrible,\" said Gallant. \"I have never seen any wild animals suffering from such intense seizures before.\"\n\nGallant noted that the foxes, while still alive, had been seizing so badly that she doubts they were even aware that they had been picked up and moved. \"I think they were comatose, basically. Which is probably a blessing, because it was really horrible,\" she said. \"I probably will see it in my mind for quite a while.\"\n\nOther foxes in the litter, who had also shown signs of illness, were brought to the AVC. There, they were euthanized and were given a lab test to determine the cause of illness.\n\nAs of 24 May 2022, the results for one of the 3 foxes had come in, showing a preliminary positive for avian influenza. \"With avian influenza, it's a big outbreak that's happening right now,\" said Jones, noting the number of cases across Canada and the United States since December 2021.\n\nTo date, in PEI, the only confirmed cases of the virus had been in birds, Jones said that in the last month, there have been cases of avian influenza found in foxes in Ontario and several US states. \"It's something that we actually had on our radar,\" said Jones.\n\nThe virus, she added, would likely have spread to the fox via eating a dead or sick bird that carried the disease. She added that it is unlikely to spread from mammal to mammal.\n\nWhen an animal contracts avian influenza, the illness gets into the brain, damages brain cells and causes signs like seizures, twitching, lack of balance or lethargy. If anyone sees an animal exhibiting these symptoms, Jones advises them to contact the PEI Fish and Wildlife department, rather than handling the animal themselves -- particularly since these symptoms are similar to signs of rabies in mammals.\n\n\"This virus can affect people,\" said Jones. \"We would always recommend against handling any sick birds directly or any sick mammals directly, as well.\"\n\nKnowing that at least one of the foxes may have contracted avian influenza is \"frightening\" for Gallant, who had 2 of their littermates in her house. \"I've not had any water  in my house. Any adult birds that come in that are injured are not coming in my house, they're staying out in isolation because of avian influenza,\" said Gallant. \"When Kyra brought the 2 foxes to me that were dying of seizures, they were in my kitchen. That's where I looked at them. So I brought avian influenza in my house without bringing a bird in.\"\n\nThose 2 foxes, though, have been cremated and are unable to be tested to see if they may have avian flu, like their siblings. \"But I'm kind of assuming that whatever killed the 1st two have killed the 2nd two that went to the Atlantic Vet. College,\" said Gallant.\n\nThe experience, although \"horrible\" for Gallant, has made her exercise extra caution with every animal that comes into her care. She also noted that the remaining littermates, as of Friday 20 May 2022, appeared to be healthy, and Gallant hoped that they were not merely asymptomatic carriers.\n\n\"Hopefully this is a one-off and we don't hear it anymore,\" she said. \"We have so many issues with mange in foxes on the Island, so many killed getting hit by cars. I like our wildlife here on the Island.\"\n\n\n\n--\n"

Most of the seals were found dead. On [1 Jul 2022], the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed that samples from 4 stranded seals in Maine have tested positive for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1. All of these animals had recently died or required euthanasia. USDA is notifying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as state animal and public health officials. The finding will be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health.\n\nThe current rate of dead seal strandings in this area is approximately 3 times the normal rate for this time of the year. During elevated stranding events such as this, the Marine Mammal Stranding Network collaborates with NOAA Fisheries to further investigate. They consider environmental conditions, common factors contributing to past stranding events, and any potential human impacts. They also obtain information on the causes of illness and death in the seals. The Network will continue to collect and analyze as new cases are documented. Response, recovery and sampling protocols for seals are in place and being led by MMoME.\n\nSeal mortality events have occurred in southern Maine previously. The most recent Unusual Mortality Event in seals occurred in 2018 due to phocine distemper virus. These events can last for several months to several years. They are challenging when the event involves infectious diseases with the potential for spread across wildlife species and domestic animals or humans. Learn more about unusual mortality events at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/active-and-closed-unusual-mortality-events.\n\nNOAA Fisheries has established a coordinated response structure with MMoME, Atlantic Marine Conservation Society, and state and federal partners to manage this event. The response team is currently meeting on a daily basis to share information, support response logistics, and develop accurate public communications. The webpage will be updated on a regular basis as new information becomes available.\n\n--\n"

He said the seals most likely were in contact with carcasses of infected eider ducks when they came ashore to give birth at the beginning of the summer. \"Some seals, including the grey seal, are known for eating wild birds ... but not harbour seals,\" Lair said in an interview. \"They are curious, they will smell carcasses.\"\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Gosselin, a biologist with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, said these are the first reported cases of the virus being passed from wild birds to marine mammals in Quebec. The 1st H5N1 flu cases are believed to have arrived in North America at the end of winter, involving birds that migrated from Europe. Gosselin said the number of dead seals reported likely understates the reality. \"It's already difficult to count the number of seals that are alive ... carcasses that are beached, or floating between rocks, is even harder,\" Gosselin said. He added that it's difficult to monitor all transmission, which most likely is affecting other species -- on land as well as marine mammals.\n\nGosselin and Lair both said that while they are monitoring the situation, there is no threat of transmission to humans or of endangering the seal population. \"It's normal with an exotic virus ... it's a new virus that enters a new population that was never infected,\" Lair said. \"The mortality rate will be way higher than if the virus was already circulating naturally.\" \"We need to be careful about all predators or animals that could be in contact with wild birds,\" Gosselin said. Both recommended that people avoid approaching or touching animal carcasses and keep their pets, particularly dogs, away.\n\n\n\n--\n"

A collaboration between UF College of Veterinary Medicine researchers and state and federal laboratories identified the unexpected infection with HPAIV, commonly known as bird flu. The virus recovered from the dolphin belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b of the Eurasian H5 viral lineage.\n\nWild birds have spread H5 clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIV widely in North America and Europe this year [2022]. The virus primarily affects wild birds and domesticated poultry but only rarely infects people. Researchers suspect the dolphin likely got infected by interacting with a wild bird killed by HPAIV.\n\n\"While obviously the presence of HPAIV is a concern, the key takeaway for us is that additional caution should be taken by those handling or encountering wild dolphins during rescue events or while performing necropsies,\" said Mike Walsh, DVM, a clinical associate professor with UF's College of Veterinary Medicine who leads the animal rescue team and performed the dolphin's necropsy with others.\n\nThere has been only one report of H5 clade 2.3.4.4b in people in 2022.\n\nRichard Webby, PhD, directs the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The WHO Center at St. Jude, which analyzes animal flu viruses and their potential risk to human health, will analyze the dolphin tissue samples supplied by the UF team.\n\n\"The virus has some features that make further study and follow-up on mammalian cases important, but the virus does not currently contain the features we know are required for transmission between humans and likely other mammalian hosts,\" Webby said. \"In addition, the recent discovery of HPAIV in a porpoise in Sweden almost certainly suggests that the Florida dolphin finding isn't a one-off, unique event.\"\n\nThe UF team did not immediately suspect anything out of the ordinary when they performed a routine necropsy. Tests for common causes of deaths in dolphins turned up negative.\n\n\"However, this dolphin had inflammation of the brain and also the tissues surrounding the brain, known as the meninges,\" said Robert Ossiboff, DVM, PhD, an associate professor of veterinary anatomical pathology at UF. \"This finding was unusual.\"\n\nAndrew Allison, PhD, an assistant professor of veterinary virology at UF, studies viruses that normally circulate in wildlife populations, primarily wild birds and mammals. He knew that HPAIV was a rapidly growing concern for wild bird populations in Florida.\n\n\"Although avian flu infection had never been documented in a dolphin, the high incidence of the virus in wild birds within the state in the spring -- specifically aquatic bird species such as ducks, gulls, terns and herons -- suggested that encounters between dolphins and dying or dead birds near the shoreline was not out of the realm of possibility,\" he said.\n\nWild birds that succumb to HPAIV often have neurologic signs with virus found in their brains. Since the dolphin had inflammation of the brain and meninges that could have been caused by a virus, Allison believed that the dolphin could have died from HPAIV infection.\n\nOn the basis of these initial suspicions, the UF researchers sent brain and lung samples of the dolphin to the state's Bronson Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Kissimmee, a nationally accredited facility and a member of the National Animal Health Laboratory network (NAHLN). This lab is approved for and routinely performs testing for animal pathogens of significant consequence that can pose severe threats to animals and humans. There, suspicions were confirmed, as the samples tested positive for avian flu. As a NAHLN laboratory, avian flu detections are sent on to the National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, for characterization by genetic sequencing to identify the specific strain of avian flu.\n\nUF's marine animal rescue team is a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Southeast Regional Stranding Network, which authorizes members to assist and investigate stranded marine mammals. The UF rescue team works closely with the stranding network, especially when investigating pathogens with unknown effects in cetaceans.\n\n\n\n--\n"

The analysis shows that the porpoise died as a result of the same virus that was behind this summer's extensive bird flu outbreak among wild birds.\n\nThe young male porpoise stranded alive in K\u00e4mpersvik, in Tanum municipality, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland 28 Jun 2022. Despite repeated attempts by private individuals to get it to swim out to deeper water again, it was too exhausted, got tangled in seaweed, and died later in the evening. The porpoise was transported to SVA for an autopsy. The analysis now shows that bird flu virus was found in several organs and that the virus had caused meningitis. The findings confirm that the bird flu virus was the cause of death.\n\nAs far as we know, this is the 1st confirmed case in the world of bird flu in a porpoise. Unlike seals, where disease outbreaks caused by influenza viruses have been repeatedly demonstrated, there are only isolated reports of influenza viruses in cetaceans. It is likely that the porpoise somehow came into contact with infected birds, says Elina Thorsson, game veterinarian at SVA.\n\nThe virus, H5N1, is the same virus that was also behind the extensive bird flu outbreak that is still ongoing among wild birds in Sweden, other parts of Europe, and in North America. How the porpoise from K\u00e4mpersvik was infected is still unknown, but it was found at the same time as bird flu was causing high mortality among seabirds, especially gannets, on the west coast.\n\nIt is an unusual find, and interesting because we get the opportunity to learn more about the virus. At the same time, this is about an individual case, and we have not seen any increased mortality among porpoises. We know that there is a risk that marine mammals can become infected, and have therefore included sampling for influenza in our surveillance program, says Elina Thorsson.\n\nThe risk of humans being infected with the variant of bird flu that is now circulating among wild birds is considered to be small.\n\nDuring the ongoing bird flu outbreak in Europe and North America, in addition to large numbers of dead wild birds, a smaller number of mammals have also been infected and died. The route of infection is suspected to be through close contact with infected birds. Single cases have been detected in red foxes, otters, lynxes, and skunks. Increased mortality in both harbor seals and gray seals has been seen in connection with the outbreak in North America, but in Sweden there have been no increased reports of dead seals during the summer [2022].\n\n\n\n--\n"

Mink in the farm were tested following regular surveillance procedures after the occurrence of sick mink in the farm with respiratory symptoms and an unusual increase in deaths of the animals. Mink were tested for several diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Two samples tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N1).\n\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) has recently been detected in Spain in domestic and wild birds. Strict measures were immediately implemented on the farm by the official veterinary services. Following a public health risk assessment by Spanish authorities, mink were culled in the farm that kept 8369 breeding females and 43 617 weaned offspring, and the farm premises were cleaned and disinfected. As a precautionary measure, the Ministry of Rural Affairs initiated surveillance of poultry and mink farms located around the affected farm. Among other measures, it will be prohibited to keep concentrations of birds and the release of hunting birds for repopulation.\n\n--\n"

It is believed that the cub, which was located in Bartlett Cove in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve west of Juneau, is the second bear diagnosed with the highly pathogenic bird flu, the Juneau Empire reported.\n\nBird flu \"passes really easily to poultry, but mammals aren't really susceptible to it,\" said Dr Kimberlee Beckmen, a wildlife veterinarian for the department. \"It's difficult to get, but we suspect the cub probably ate a bird that died from avian influenza.\" The bear likely became ill because it was a small, young animal with a weak immune system, she said.\n\nSince the virus was first detected in an adult female black bear in Canada in June [2022], Alaska state officials have tested scavenging animals for it. So far, it's only been found in 2 other animals, both red foxes in Dutch Harbor and the western Alaska community of Unalakleet. Finding bird flu in the bear and foxes is not an indication it's likely to spread to other animals or to people, Beckmen said. \"This particular strain, people are pretty much immune to it,\" she said.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this strain of bird flu poses a \"very low\" risk to humans, and only one person in the US has been diagnosed in this outbreak. However, the flu has hammered the state's wild bird population.\n\nPeople in Glacier Bay last month [October 2022] noticed that the cub, one of 3 accompanying a sow, had difficulty walking, according to state wildlife officials. The sow abandoned the cub and a biologist picked it up. However, it began suffering seizures, as did the Canadian bear previously diagnosed with the illness. The Alaska bear was euthanized by a state biologist. Later testing confirmed the presence of the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza.\n\n--\n"

This juvenile male dolphin was found dead on a beach near Rimouski, Quebec  on 5 Sep 2022. The carcass was presented by the Quebec Marine Mammal Emergency Response Network (RQUMM) to the CWHC -- Quebec regional center for analysis.\n\nThe animal was in good physical condition, suggesting death from an acute event. Apart from the presence of low intensity parasitic infections, no gross lesions were observed in the animal. Histopathological examination of the tissues revealed the presence of inflammatory and necrotic lesions in the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen. Acute inflammatory lesions were also present in the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (very mild encephalitis). Molecular analyses carried out by the laboratory of the Minist\u00e8re de l'Agriculture, des P\u00eacheries et de l'Alimentation du Qu\u00e9bec revealed the presence of an AIV H5N1 in the brain. This result was confirmed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency laboratory. The results of these tests indicate that this dolphin died as a result of an acute infection with an AIV H5N1 virus.\n\nAlthough the H5N1 AIV viruses primarily affect birds, several mammalian species are also known to be susceptible. In marine mammals, infections with this virus have been documented mainly in common seals, but cases have also been reported in some gray seals. Until recently, no cases of fatal avian influenza virus infections had been documented in cetaceans (whales and dolphins). To our knowledge, only 2 cases of AIV H5N1 infection in cetaceans have been reported so far, one case in a bottlenose dolphin in Florida  and one case in a harbor porpoise in Sweden. The case presented here, which would therefore be the 1st case of infection with this virus in a white-sided dolphin, indicates that this species is susceptible to this virus emerging in North America.\n\nData collected by the RQUMM does not appear to indicate an increase in white-sided dolphin mortality in the St Lawrence Estuary this summer [2022], despite the presence of an outbreak among common seals. This suggests that there has been no transmission of this virus between dolphins and therefore the number of cases should be limited; contact between dolphins and infected birds is probably rare.\n\nAlthough the risk of transmission of this flu virus to humans and pets seems low, it is recommended not to approach, and above all not to touch, sick or dead marine mammals. Contact between our pets and dead wild animals should also be avoided.\n\n--\n"

They were all discovered last year [2022].\n\nAccording to APHA, samples taken as part of routine wildlife surveillance detected the presence of H5N1 influenza of avian origin also in 4 foxes -- all in England.\n\nNow monitoring is being stepped up to see if the virus that has devastated bird populations is taking a foothold in other species like otters. The APHA reports that 20 mammals have been retrospectively tested, of which 8 were influenza A(H5N1) positive. It states: \"The species affected (foxes and otters) are presumed to have direct high-level exposure to infected birds based on feeding behaviour and food preferences. The avian influenza outbreak in the UK is assessed as at risk level 3 although there is (sic) limited mammalian surveillance data. At present, there are no indicators of increasing risk to human health, however, this is a low confidence assessment. The risk assessment is dynamic and requires regular review during this period of unusually high levels of transmission in birds with mammalian spillover.\"\n\nA spokesman for NatureScot said: \"We are concerned about the unprecedented outbreak of avian flu over the last 2 years and continue to work with partners through the Scottish Task Force to ensure that we have the correct monitoring and best advice for land managers in place. Animals scavenging on dead birds and then succumbing to avian flu has been reported in a number of countries, but thankfully at very low levels.\"\n\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"No additional mammals have tested positive for HPAI in Scotland beyond those already reported. The risk of the H5N1 strain to non-avian UK wildlife is low. A surveillance programme remains in place for the testing of certain mammalian wildlife species for avian influenza virus. We advise members of the public to not touch any sick or dead wild animals and make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after contact with any animal.\"\n\nThe Scottish Wildlife Trust says bird flu has now been confirmed in 37 bird species in Scotland including herring gulls, several geese, mute swans, guillemots, kittiwakes, razorbills, and puffins.\n\n\n\n--\n"

Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in farmed minks, Spain, October 2022. Euro Surveill. 2023; 28(3)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nIn October 2022, an outbreak in Europe of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) in intensively farmed minks occurred in north west Spain. A single mink farm hosting more than 50 000 minks was involved. The identified viruses belong to clade 2.3.4.4b, which is responsible of the ongoing epizootic in Europe. An uncommon mutation (T271A) in the PB2 gene with potential public health implications was found. Our investigations indicate onward mink transmission of the virus may have occurred on the affected farm.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the 1st report of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI H5N1 virus infection of minks farmed for their fur in Europe. The viruses identified presented the highest similarity with strains of the A/gull/France/22P015977/2022-like genotype, which has already been described in multiple wild bird species and sporadically in poultry across northern Europe. However, the viruses detected at the mink farm are distinguished from all the clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses characterised thus far in the avian population in Europe as they bear an uncommon mutation (T271A) in the PB2 gene, which may have public health implications. Indeed, the same mutation is present in the avian-like PB2 gene of the 2009 pandemic swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus (H1N1pdm). Zhang et al. demonstrated that mutations to the avian virus-conserved residue (threonine, T) reduced polymerase activity and abolished the H1N1pdm virus respiratory droplet transmission in guinea pigs. Furthermore, this study shows that amino acid 271A of PB2 plays a key role in virus acquisition of the mutation at position 226 of HA that confers human receptor recognition. As T271A is an uncommon amino acid change not previously identified among European HPAI H5 viruses in 2020-22, with the exception of a single H5N1 virus from a mammalian host (European polecat), this mutation could have arisen de novo in minks. However, the data available are not sufficient to exclude the possibility of an unobserved circulation of avian viruses bearing this substitution in the avian population.\n\nOur findings also indicate that an onward transmission of the virus to other minks may have taken place in the affected farm. This is suggested by the increasing number of infected animals identified after the confirmation of the disease and the progression of the infection from the initially affected area to the entire holding. Additional experimental studies are ongoing to further explore virulence and transmissibility of these viruses.\n\nThe source of the outbreak remains unknown. No AI cases were reported in poultry farms supplying the poultry by-products. However, considering that the mink spillover event was coincident with a wave of H5N1 virus infections in seabirds in Galicia, it can be assumed that wild birds may have played a major role in the virus introduction into the farm. This hypothesis is further supported given that minks were farmed in a partially open building and may have been in contact with wild birds. Indeed, the A/gull/France/22P015977/2022-like genotype has been diagnosed in multiple seabird species across Europe, including common gannets and seagulls, which were the species involved in the H5N1 mortality events registered in Galicia in the weeks before the mink outbreak. Sequencing of the contemporary H5N1 virus-positive wild birds collected in the area will be essential to confirm this assumption.\n\nExperimental and field evidence have demonstrated that minks are susceptible and permissive to both avian and human influenza A viruses, leading to the theory that this species could serve as a potential mixing vessel for the interspecies transmission among birds, mammals and human. In light of this and considering the ongoing HPAI H5N1 panzootic, our findings further highlight the importance of preventing mink infection with such viruses.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nDespite the criticism fur farming has recently received following SARS-CoV-2 cases in farmed minks and the spillover/spillback SARS-CoV-2 transmission events reported between minks and humans, this production sector is still common worldwide with an important economic impact. For this reason, and given the concerns caused by the susceptibility of minks to emerging viruses such as HPAI H5N1 viruses and SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to strengthen the culture of biosafety and biosecurity in this farming system and promote the implementation of ad hoc surveillance programs for influenza A viruses and other zoonotic pathogens at a global level. These interventions are instrumental to prevent contact between minks and wild animals, and to control disease transmission events from minks to farm workers and vice versa.\n\n--\n"

They mark the first documented cases of avian flu in grizzly bears. The 3 bears -- 1 near Augusta, 1 near Dupuyer, and another near Kalispell -- were \"observed to be in poor condition and exhibited disorientation and partial blindness, among other neurological issues,\" the release states.\n\nA fox and a skunk in Montana also tested positive for HPAI [in 2022], and the virus has been found in raccoons, black bears, and even a coyote in other states and countries. \"We suspect these mammals probably get the virus from consuming infected birds,\" FWP wildlife veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey said in a prepared statement.\n\nAvian influenza (AI) virus is a naturally occurring virus in birds. AI viruses are classified into 2 groups, based on the severity of disease they cause in infected poultry. Low pathogenic AI viruses generally cause no clinical illness or only minor symptoms in birds. HPAI viruses are extremely infectious and fatal to poultry and some species of wild birds.\n\nAlthough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the risk of HPAI spread to humans to be very low, Montanans should take precautions when handling game birds, sick or dead birds, and mammals they find. Whenever possible, avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife. Even if an animal is not suspected to have died from a contagious disease, gloves should always be worn if a dead animal must be handled for disposal.\n\nFWP staff would like to know about unusual or unexplained cases of sickness and/or death of wild birds and animals by calling their local wildlife biologist or the wildlife lab in Bozeman at 406-577-7880 or 406-577-7882.\n\n--\n"

Scientists have been keeping tabs on this bird flu virus since the 1950s, though it wasn't deemed a threat to people until a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong among visitors to live poultry markets. As bird flu hits more and varied animals, like at the mink farm, the fear is that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people, and potentially trigger a pandemic.\n\nScientists say another kind of bird flu was likely behind the devastating 1918-1919 flu pandemic, and avian viruses played roles in other flu pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009.\n\nStill, the risk to the general public now is low, says Dr. Tim Uyeki of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA look at the bird flu virus and why it is getting renewed attention:\n\nWhat is bird flu?\n\nSome flu viruses mainly affect people, but some others chiefly occur in animals. For example, there are cases of flu that occur in dogs, plus pig -- or swine -- flu viruses. And then there are avian viruses that spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry.\n\nThe bird flu virus drawing attention today -- Type A H5N1 -- was first identified in 1959, by investigators looking into a flu outbreak in chickens in Scotland. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself.\n\nBy 2007, the virus was found in more than 60 countries. In the US, it has recently been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry operations or backyard flocks in 47 states. Since the beginning of last year, "

In the Netherlands, HPAI H5N1 virus infections were detected in 3 wild red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) that were submitted with neurological symptoms between December 2021 and February 2022. A histopathological analysis demonstrated that the virus was mainly present in the brain, with limited or no detection in the respiratory tract or other organs.\n\nLimited or no virus shedding was observed in throat and rectal swabs. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the 3 fox viruses were not closely related, but they were related to HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses that are found in wild birds. This suggests that the virus was not transmitted between the foxes. A genetic analysis demonstrated the presence of the mammalian adaptation E627K in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein of the 2 fox viruses. In both foxes, the avian (PB2-627E) and the mammalian (PB2-627K) variants were present as a mixture in the virus population, which suggests that the mutation emerged in these specific animals. The 2 variant viruses were isolated, and virus replication and passaging experiments were performed. These experiments showed that the mutation PB2-627K increases the replication of the virus in mammalian cell lines, compared to the chicken cell line, and at the lower temperatures of the mammalian upper respiratory tract.\n\nThis study showed that the HPAI H5N1 virus is capable of adaptation to mammals; however, more adaptive mutations are required to allow for efficient transmission between mammals. Therefore, surveillance in mammals should be expanded to closely monitor the emergence of zoonotic mutations for pandemic preparedness.\n\n--\n"

Franklin's gulls, red-headed vultures, cormorants, Humboldt penguins and others have also been found.\n\nIn recent weeks, avian influenza in birds has been identified as spreading to populations of sea lions in 7 marine-coastal natural protected areas, registering 585 dead sea lions. Faced with this emergency, a first response team made up of experts from SERNANP and WCS have collected samples of the affected fauna, which were analyzed by the veterinary pathology laboratory of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.\n\nThe results obtained were positive for Avian Influenza H5N1 for the species of sea lions, Humboldt penguins, boobies and oystercatchers. In addition, information has been shared between MINSA, SENASA, SERFOR and SERNANP, in order to unify a nationwide database for prevention purposes and adoption of measures for the protection of health against avian influenza.\n\nSERNANP, in its role of authority over the Natural Protected Areas, is preparing a diagnosis and monitoring guide to use during the emergency caused by said virus.\n\nIf any person observes the presence of animals visibly affected or with signs of disease or dead in one of the PNAs, they should avoid handling them. It is recommended to notify the park rangers.\n\n--\n"

State wildlife officials say it's part of a pattern of bird flu spilling over to mammals in the U.S., but the numbers are low so it's not considered an outbreak.\n\nOregon wildlife officials said they have diagnosed a handful of wild mammals with highly pathogenic avian flu -- but they do not consider it an outbreak.\n\nThe disease, commonly known as bird flu, is usually associated with wild birds and backyard flocks. It has killed thousands of birds throughout the state in recent months and led to the death and euthanization of millions of chickens and other domestic birds across the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Agriculture Department has recorded avian flu infections in 110 mammals across the country since May 2022, including 6 skunks and 1 raccoon in Oregon. The disease has not affected the state's wildlife populations, said state wildlife veterinarian Colin Gillin.\n\nIn other parts of the U.S., foxes, coyotes, bobcats, fishers, possums, bears and even seals and dolphins also were found to carry  the disease.\n\nHealth officials say it's rare for bird flu to spill over to mammals and the risk to humans is very low, though several hundred people across the world have tested positive for the disease in past years.\n\nTypically, the wild mammals diagnosed are scavengers who likely ate a very sick or recently dead bird carrying the bird flu, said Gillin. The animals also might have contracted the disease by congregating in areas contaminated with the virus, which can survive in feces or mud for several days.\n\nTransmission of bird flu from mammal to mammal has not been observed so far in Oregon or elsewhere, Gillin said, except on mink farms where the animals are packed in cages nose to nose, with little ventilation. In the wild, he added, most animals don't congregate in large groups and are usually outside in the open air.\n\nHuman infections with bird flu have most often occurred after close or lengthy contact with infected birds or places the birds touched, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While more than 800 cases have been recorded world-wide since 2003, fewer than 10 cases have been reported since 2021. The U.S. recorded its 1st case of avian influenza in humans last April "

However, HPAI was confirmed in a flock not identified as a commercial flock that involved 29 700 birds in the state on 12 Jan 2023.\n\nPrior to 12 Jan 2023, the last commercial operation in California to be affected by HPAI was a commercial upland gamebird farm in Glenn County. That case was confirmed on 22 Dec 2022.\n\nIn 2022, California had 15 cases of HPAI confirmed in commercial flocks, affecting nearly 760 000 birds.\n\nSo far in 2023, commercial flocks in the following states have had confirmed cases of HPAI: Pennsylvania, Virginia, Iowa, Tennessee and Kansas. In Canada, the provinces of British Columbia and Quebec have had cases of HPAI in commercial poultry flocks in 2023.\n\nTo learn more about HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks in the United States and Canada, see an interactive map "

The risk of the H5N1 strain to non-avian UK wildlife remains low.\"\n\nAside from the seals, this year [2023], only one other mammal, a fox in Wales, has tested positive  for influenza of avian origin.\n\nLast week, UK officials confirmed that \"enhanced\" mammalian surveillance for avian influenza was initiated at the beginning of the year [2023], mostly targeting mammals found dead near known areas of bird flu transmission.\n\nHowever, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) has said that evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission in the wild remains very limited and data does not suggest widespread mammalian adaption of the virus.\n\n\"Infection of mammals with influenza of avian origin remains uncommon and the risk of the H5N1 strain to non-avian UK wildlife remains low,\" an APHA spokesperson said.\n\n\"Samples taken as part of routine wildlife surveillance over the last year have detected the presence of influenza of avian origin in 5 foxes, 4 otters and 4 seals that were found dead -- which is an uncommon event. Advice remains unchanged to not touch any sick or dead wild animals and make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after contact with any animal.\"\n\nChief superintendent of Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA), Mike Flynn, is also urging people to keep their distance from sick, injured and dead animals.\n\n\"We strongly advise that people keep their distance from any sick, injured or dead marine animals. Dogs should also be kept on a lead around wildlife at all times,\" he said on behalf of SSPCA.\n\n\"Any birds, alive or dead, suspected of having avian flu would be a matter for Defra (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) to investigate.\"\n\nConcerns can also be directed to the SSPCA or NatureScot.\n\nDead seals, whales and dolphins should be reported to the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme.\n\n\n\n--\n"

Also in Franklin's gulls, red-headed vultures, cormorants, Humboldt penguins and others.\n\nIn recent weeks, avian influenza in birds has been identified as spreading to populations of sea lions in 7 marine-coastal natural protected areas, registering 585 dead sea lions. Faced with this emergency, a first-response team made up of experts from Sernanp and WCS have collected samples of the affected fauna, which were analyzed by the veterinary pathology laboratory of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.\n\nThe results obtained were positive for avian influenza H5N1 for the species of sea lions, Humboldt penguin, booby and oystercatcher. In addition, information has been shared between Minsa, Senasa, Serfor and Sernanp to unify a nationwide database for prevention purposes and adoption of measures for the protection of health against avian influenza.\n\nThe Sernanp, in its role of authority of the Natural Protected Areas, is preparing a diagnosis and monitoring guide for the attention of the sanitary conflict during the emergency caused by said virus.\n\nIf any person observes the presence of animals visibly affected or with signs of disease or dead in one of the PNAs, they should avoid handling them. It is recommended to notify the park rangers.\n\n--\n"

The disease has been found in raccoons in Washington, but this is the first time avian influenza has been found in a bobcat, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife  spokeswoman Staci Lehman said. \"It's not unexpected,\" she said. \"We know it has transferred to mammals. (But) we only had raccoons until now.\"\n\nIn the past 9 months, WDFW has documented three raccoons with avian influenza, including one in Spokane County. While the disease is common in birds, it's rarer to find it in mammals. It has been detected in red foxes, striped skunks, and bobcats in other states, according to a WDFW blog post. Washington had the first detection of the disease in raccoons in North America, and the raccoons were the first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a mammal in Washington state.\n\nAs to whether the disease poses a risk to domestic animals or humans, WDFW said it's unlikely. \"We don't want people to panic,\" Lehman said. \"But we do want to get the word out. As usual, don't touch dead things.\"\n\n--\n"

A total of 10 bush dogs at the unnamed zoo died in what is being described as an isolated event last November [2022]. The H5N1 avian influenza virus was detected in the dead animals through retrospective sampling, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.\n\nWhile mammal-to-mammal transmission has not been confirmed in the dogs, it is one line of investigation. There is a possibility that the dogs caught the virus through infected birds fed to them by zookeepers.\n\nIn its updated risk assessment for bird flu, the UKHSA said the UK is currently at Level 3, meaning there is \"limited mammalian transmission.\" This is a change in wording from the last assessment, when the alert level was described as \"changes in the virus genome that could lead to mammal-to-mammal transmission.\"\n\nHowever, the UKHSA insisted the level of risk had not changed. A spokesperson said: \"The risk to human health has not changed. As previously, there is low confidence evidence of limited transmission in mammals, but there is no current evidence that this risk is changing.\"\n\nA previous assessment defined the risk as spillover infections in mammals with non-sustained transmissions between mammals, and the scale of risk had been changed to provide more granular detail, a source said.\n\nBut scientists are on high alert for transmission between animals after incidents of mass infections and deaths of mammals in areas around the world, including farmed mink in Spain, seals in the Caspian Sea and sea lions in Peru.\n\nThere have been 23 deaths of wild mammals in the UK since the current outbreak of the highly infectious H5N1 virus began 18 months ago, including 2 dolphins, mainly due to isolated cases of animals scavenging on infected dead birds. The 10 bush dogs would take the total of wild and captive mammals that have died to 33.\n\nGovernment scientists insist there is no change to the risk to human health, which is classed as very low. Scientists at the UKHSA and the SPI-M group, which produced modelling of the COVID pandemic for the government, have also revealed different scenarios for what would happen in a human pandemic of bird flu.\n\nWhile there is still no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the UKHSA said it wanted to prepare for the emergence of novel influenza viruses. The current risks assessment says the H5N1 virus can \"successfully infect mammals and humans with high levels of direct exposure (for example, scavenger mammalian species, humans working closely with birds).\"\n\nThere have been only 7 cases of bird flu in humans since October 2021. It adds: \"Polymerase basic protein (PB2) mutations associated with mammalian adaptation, including E627K, are seen in mammalian infections. There is evidence of transmission in farmed mink and possible, though unconfirmed, transmission in populations of seals and sea lions.\"\n\nDr Meera Chand, Deputy Director at UKHSA, said: \"The latest evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating in birds do not currently spread easily to people. However, viruses constantly evolve, and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population. It is right that we prepare for the emergence of novel influenza viruses, and we are working with partners to ensure that we have the tools and capabilities in place for these and other emerging infections.\"\n\n\n\n--\n"

This male specimen was stranded dead in the vicinity of the Lluta River wetland near Las Machas beach  along with other birds, for which the procedure for suspicion was started with the corresponding sampling conducted jointly\nwith the Chilean Secretariat of Agriculture (SAG)\", said Tapia.\n\nThis is the 1st specimen of the _Lontra felina_ species officially affected in our country by avian influenza. This is added to the confirmation of a 3rd common sea lion with a positive result, this time in the Tarapac\u00e1 region. The balance to date indicates that 4 marine mammals have been reported infected with HPAI.\n\n\"Let's remember that until last week [first of Mar 2023] the focus was on the Antofagasta region, with 2 sea lions and 2 penguins, and today we already have confirmation of affected marine mammals in the Arica and Parinacota, and Tarapac\u00e1 regions,\" confirmed the national director of Sernapesca.\n\nThis case (marine otter) also corresponds to the variant of the H5 virus that has already been detected in wild birds in 12 regions of the country, and that is present in countries of the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nThe entity that controls fishing and aquaculture activity, SERNAPESCA, indicated that they have activated a special plan to address this contingency. On the one hand, a territorial deployment that consists of a special surveillance system in coastal areas identified as at risk, and, on the other hand, to strengthen the notification systems, in order to determine early cases of avian influenza in marine animals. In addition, work is being done in coordination with the presidential delegations of the northern zone regions where positive cases have been documented, the SAG, MINSAL , and other regional and local authorities, such as municipalities.\n\nIn addition to the measures mentioned above, SERNAPESCA and the Undersecretary of Fisheries and Aquaculture, SUBPESCA, have been working together since February [2023] at the level of authorities and with expert technical teams, to safeguard the health of those who carry out various jobs associated with artisanal fishing and other sectoral agents that cohabit with marine species susceptible to contagion with avian influenza, or that maintain higher levels of interactions with marine fauna, by coordinating a series of training workshops, especially in places identified as high risk. \"Through our regional directorates and the fishing zones of the Undersecretary, we will train our users in biosecurity measures, to avoid risky manipulation. Our interest is that men and women of the sea remain safe,\" said Tapia.\n\n--\n"

Regarding organization, the National Directorate of the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service (El Servicio Nacional de Pesca y Acuicultura; SERNAPESCA) carries out the risk assessment and defines the actions to be implemented in each zone; regional directorates are responsible for implementing these measures. To date, the agent has not been detected in other marine mammals. Following the 1st detection of the pathogen, and based on the location where the affected animal got stranded, a disease control zone was defined along the coastline, where notification of stranded animals is reinforced with sectoral users and clinical and molecular surveillance is implemented in animals with signs and symptoms consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza, aimed at the early detection and timely control of the spread of the virus. In geographic areas that are not within this zone, passive surveillance will be maintained, focusing on the follow-up of reports.\n\nControl measures applied at event level, wild animals: surveillance outside the restricted zone; surveillance within the restricted zone; disinfection; control of wildlife reservoirs; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste.\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Result date / Result\n / South American sea lion / 1 / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 15 Feb 2023 / positive\n\n\n\n--\n"

The H5N1 strain has already caused many bird deaths in Europe and North America, and it is now believed to have infected over 112 species, including marine birds.\n\nSince December 2021, there have been increasing reports of H5N1 infections in wild bird species in Europe, and even mammals such as red foxes and mustelids are not immune to viral spillover.\n\nAccording to recent findings, harbor seals (_Phoca vitulina_) and grey seals (_Halichoerus grypus_) in North America are susceptible to the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus. Although seals have been known to be vulnerable to influenza A viral infections, there are very few reports of influenza infections in cetaceans. Hence, the discovery of an H5N1 infection in a _Phocoena phocoena_ (harbor porpoise) individual is alarming.\n\nIn this study, researchers reported a case of a stranded male _P. phocoena_ individual on the west coast of Sweden. The porpoise appeared to be unwell, and it was swimming in circles, unable to right itself. Unfortunately, the porpoise died shortly after getting stranded, and therefore the carcass was subjected to necropsy.\n\nTypically, when porpoises are found stranded, they undergo screening to detect the presence of cetacean morbilliviruses and influenza A virus, both of which can affect the nervous system in cetaceans as well as other species.\n\nTo test for cetacean morbillivirus, samples of the spleen, lung, and brain are analyzed using a technique called real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Additionally, samples taken from the bronchial and lung swabs are examined to detect the presence of influenza A viral genome.\n\nAfter identifying the presence of the influenza A virus in the swab samples, further analysis was conducted on other organs to measure the viral loads. Moreover, a technique called immunohistochemical analysis was carried out using a primary monoclonal antibody specific to the influenza A nucleoprotein, which is commercially available, to determine the distribution of the viral antigen and its relationship with pathological lesions.\n\nThe necropsy results indicated no major macroscopic findings except for pulmonary edema, which resulted from drowning. However, microscopic analysis of the brain revealed evidence of lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis, characterized by gliosis, necrosis, vasculitis, and perivascular cuffing. Additionally, the lung tissue showed a higher number of alveolar macrophages and evidence of mononuclear septal thickening.\n\nAlthough cetacean morbilliviral ribonucleic acid (RNA) was not detected by rRT-PCR, swab samples revealed the presence of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. High levels of the virus were found in the brain, followed by the lungs, kidney, liver, and spleen. No traces of the virus were found in the blubber, muscles, or intestines.\n\nDuring the immunohistochemical analysis, the researchers observed moderate levels of immunolabelling in the cytoplasm and nuclei of neurons, choroid plexus epithelial cells, and glial cells. Lower levels of antigens were found in the cytoplasm and nuclei of scattered alveolar cells, including sloughed epithelial cells and macrophages. No viral antigens were detected in any other tissue.\n\nThe researchers hypothesized that the meningoencephalitis could have been responsible for the unusual behavior observed in the harbor seal, ultimately leading to its death by drowning. The presence of high levels of the virus in the brain was consistent with infections of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in mammalian species. Since the viral strain closely resembled the H5N1 strain circulating among wild birds, it is possible that the virus was transmitted through contaminated water or direct contact with an infected bird.\n\nThe findings suggest that the H5N1 virus has an expanding host range, and its sporadic infection in other mammalian species increases the risk of its growing transmissibility and virulence.\n\nIn summary, this study identified the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in a stranded harbor seal in Sweden. The necropsy showed microscopic evidence of lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis, which was believed to be the probable cause of the abnormal behavior and subsequent drowning.\n\nGenomic and immunohistochemical analyses revealed high levels of the H5N1 virus in the brain and lungs. These findings underscore the growing risk of H5N1 spillover to mammalian species and highlight the urgent need for enhanced animal health surveillance and intervention strategies.\n\n--\n"

The H5N1 subtype of the virus has resulted in huge death tolls among wild bird populations, as well as tens of millions of poultry deaths in Europe and North America.\n\nSpillover into mammals from birds has been documented during the global outbreak that started in 2020, but until now this was known only in small and localised events. The team behind the research demonstrated that more than 330 harbour seals and grey seals died in relation to bird flu on the New England coast in June and July 2022.\n\nThe lead authors of the study, Wendy Puryear and Kaitlin Sawatzki, work at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University. They both have an extensive history of researching viruses in seals and say the bird flu findings are down to a strong data set formed by information from wildlife clinics and rehabilitation centres in New England.\n\nPuryear said: \"We have a better resolution and greater depth of detail on this virus than before because we were able to sequence it and detect changes almost in real time. And we have pairings of samples, sometimes literally from a bird and a seal on the same beach.\"\n\nTufts Wildlife Clinic has monitored the virus in birds and some mammals since January 2022, recording a minimum of 3 strains that had crossed over from Europe. They were also able to test almost all seals that came through the Greater Atlantic Region Marine Mammal Stranding Network, regardless of whether the seal was visibly sick, and gather genetic data on any viruses detected.\n\nSawatzki said: \"Because of the genetic data that we gathered, we were the 1st to see a strain of the virus that's unique to New England. The data set will allow us to more meaningfully address questions of which animals are passing the virus to which animals and how the virus is changing.\"\n\nThe team found that the mass mortality event in seals coincided with the virus hitting local gull populations severely. It is thought seals could easily pick up the virus from gulls as they share the same habitat and can easily come into contact with gull excrement.\n\nH5N1 is nearly 100% fatal in domestic and wild birds, other than wildfowl, and this appears to be the case in mammals too. All seals testing positive for bird flu were either dead or dying, with no survivors, though it is possible that potential cases of asymptomatic or recovered animals would not have reached the stranding network. It is also uncertain whether the virus has been passed between seals, or the animals have only picked the disease up from gulls.\n\nIn Peru, where 60 000 pelicans, penguins, and gulls died of bird flu, it has been announced that 3500 sea lions succumbed to the virus. Seal mortality possibly related to bird flu has also been reported from Canada and Russia. No cases of bird flu have been detected on the Atlantic coast since the end of summer 2022, but the 'stranding season' is due to come around again soon and may reveal that the virus persists.\n\nAuthorities say that the risk to public health from bird flu remains low, with less than 10 cases of H5N1 reported in humans since December 2021 and all of these related to people with direct exposure to infected poultry. A single-dose vaccination is available for poultry but is not currently used on a large scale, and there are currently no solutions for infections in wildlife populations.\n\nThe researchers said that tight biosecurity is vital for limiting the spread of the virus within and between species, advising thorough monitoring and strict separation of domestic and wild animals.\n\n--\n"

To date, 10 regions of the country have reported protected marine wildlife positive to HPAI H5, with cases from Arica to Biob\u00edo.\n\nSo far, 35 animals have been confirmed positive for HPAI: 2 marine otters, 25 sea lions, 4 Humboldt penguins, 2 porpoises, and now 2 Chilean dolphins, one in Maule and the other one in Nuble.\n\nSERNAPESCA  reported that strandings continue to occur along the Chilean coast. In total, 3347 specimens of sea lions, 958 Humboldt penguins, 16 marine otters, 15 porpoises, and 11 Chilean dolphins have already been reported. The northern macrozone concentrates the highest mortality of these animals, with the region of Arica and Parinacota leading the ranking with 1486 dead animals, followed by Antofagasta with 752, Atacama with 623, Tarapac\u00e1 with 484, and Coquimbo with 412. On the other hand, in southern Chile, the Biob\u00edo region stands out with 200 dead marine animals, associated with the avian influenza epidemic.\n\nSoledad Tapia, National Director of SERNAPESCA, said that \"we have already recorded 2415% more dead stranded marine animals than last year [2022] in the country, and this is attributed to the phenomenon of HPAI that we are facing not only in Chile but also in various countries in South and North America, Europe, and Asia.\"\n\nFrom SERNAPESCA they expressed concern about the situation of the Chilean dolphin, also known as the \"black tonina\". \"This is an endemic species of our country, that is, it is a small cetacean that is found almost exclusively along the coasts of Chile. It is distributed from Valpara\u00edso to the south of Navarino Island and Cape Horn, and it is a protected species. We reported 2 positive cases of avian influenza in this species, which we attribute to the fact that they share a habitat with sea lions, since, like these mammals, Chilean dolphins are coastal species,\" said Tapia.\n\nAnother worrying situation is the conservation of the Humboldt penguin, which has already recorded 933 casualties in this avian flu contingency. \"A total population of no more than 11 000 Humboldt penguins in our country is estimated, which is not very numerous because this species has a highly localized distribution. In general, it is estimated that the Humboldt penguin population is in continuous decline, and its category is vulnerable according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In this episode, we are close to losing 10% of this species, and that certainly worries us,\" said Tapia.\n\nIn this context of the avian influenza emergency, work has been reinforced with other entities such as the presidential delegations, regional governments, SAG , serem\u00c3\u00adas (regional ministerial secretariats), municipalities, and others, to support the active surveillance efforts throughout the coastline to reduce the risks of viral circulation, through the detection, testing, and final disposal of affected animals.\n\nThe service reiterated the emphatic call to people on the coastline not to touch, or handle live or dead stranded marine animals, keep their distance, and report to 800 320 032.\n\n--\n"

A dog in Canada died of bird flu last week.\n\nIn Wyoming, the State Veterinary Laboratory said in a brief statement that a barn cat tested positive for bird flu near Thermopolis, a small town in Hot Springs County, about 110 miles southeast of Casper. \"This is the first report of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) in a domestic cat in Wyoming, and it likely became infected from ingesting meat from wild waterfowl,\" the lab's statement said. There was no information about the cat's condition, but Dr Myrna Miller, the lab's supervisor of virology, said several semi-feral cats and skunks were recently found dead at or near the ranch. The other animals have not been tested.\n\nAfter a previous version of this article was published on Thursday night, Dr Miller informed BNO News about a recent case in Nebraska where two domestic cats had also tested positive for H5N1. Dr Sarah Sillman, from the University of Nebraska's Veterinary Diagnostic Center, wrote in a case report that two domestic cats died in January after being infected with bird flu, presumably from predation of wild birds.\n\nThe first cat in Nebraska died after experiencing a \"rapid decline\" in health with multiple symptoms, including weight loss, fever, seizures, tremors and loss of proprioception. \"The PCR Ct value for avian influenza in the brain of this cat was remarkably low (12), indicating a very large amount of virus in the brain, as consistent with an acute infection,\" Dr Sillman wrote.\n\nThree other cats in the household were considered to be at risk of bird flu and one of them developed symptoms shortly after the first affected cat. \"The cat was described as somnolent and had episodes of walking in circles,\" Dr Sillman wrote. \"The cat was responsive to stimuli and seemed to eat and drink normally. It lived 10 days with neurologic impairment, when the cat suddenly became laterally recumbent with continual tremors, necessitating euthanasia.\"\n\nA necropsy found major lesions only in the brain of the second cat and a test was positive for H5N1, Dr Sillman said. The other two cats in the household did not develop symptoms and both tested negative for the virus. \"It is presumed that the two cats described here became infected from predation of wild birds infected with the virus given the circumstances of the case,\" Dr Sillman said. \"Keeping cats indoors to prevent wild bird contact -- particularly given the context of the current HPAI outbreak -- and avoiding feeding uncooked poultry are recommendations to minimize risk of H5N1 infection.\"\n\nIt's believed to be the first time that cats in the US have been infected with the new strain of H5N1, which emerged in late 2021. In December, a cat living near a duck farm in southern France also tested positive for H5N1. The cat became severely ill and had to be euthanised. Earlier this week, the Canadian Public Health Agency confirmed that a dog in Ontario had died of H5N1 after chewing on a dead goose. It was the first time a dog tested positive for the new strain of the virus. In addition to the cat, Wyoming also reported that four mountain lions and a fox have recently died of bird flu.\n\nThe global spread of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b -- and the recent spread to a growing number of mammals -- has raised concern about the possibility of a future variant which could lead to human-to-human transmission. So far, only a few human cases have been found after contact with infected birds. \"The global H5N1 situation is worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including in humans,\" Dr Sylvie Briand, a WHO official, said on February 24. \"WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries.\"\n\n--\n"

We know wild birds, particularly water fowl, have been affected in large numbers by HPAI, but in recent months we have detected the virus in wild carnivorous mammals including mountain lions and a red fox. This is the first report of HPAI in a domestic cat in Wyoming, and it likely became infected from ingesting meat from wild waterfowl.\n\nClinical signs for mammals include those associated with neurological signs including change in behavior, decrease in awareness of surroundings and loss of energy. These signs may be indistinguishable from an animal affected with rabies. For testing of domestic species, we recommend your veterinarian submitting the whole carcass .\n\nPlease contact the Wyoming Game and Fish Dept (WGFD) for disposal recommendations for any dead waterfowl your pets can access, or to report dead or sick wild carnivores. As the HPAI outbreak continues, please make sure you are using gloves and masks when handling sick or dead mammals and birds. Report any sick wildlife to the WGFD through the online reporting tool at the link in the title.\n\n--\n"

While additional disease testing is being conducted to rule out the possibility of co-infections, HPAI H5N1 is suspected to be the cause of the death of both mountain lions.\n\nThis is the 2nd species of wild mammal known to have contracted HPAI H5N1 in California since the virus was reported in wild birds in July 2022.
